KNOWLEDGE

ðŸ’¢ sentence: an assertion about the world in a knowledge representing language
Propositional logic -> statements about the world which can be either true or false.
	Logical connective: OR, AND, NOT, Implication, Bi-Implication
ðŸ’¢ model: assignment of a truth value to every propositional symbol -> in other words creates a possible world.
Knowledge base: a set of sentences that the AI knows
Entailment: If alpha entails Beta -> then if alpha is true then beta has to be true.
(entailment sounds like implication by definition but is basically a stronger connection than implication)
(there is no case of vacuously true)

Model checking algo: enumerate all possible states our world and check whatever logical operation manually. For example if we have to check if AB |= C (AB entails C)
Then we will enumerate all possible states of A and B and in all the models where AB is true if C is true then we know that AB entails C
ðŸ’¢ inference: Making a statement using the other statement.

Basically the entirety of boolean logic and boolean algebra. Already covered in DSM course in colege.

Inference by resolution:
For example to check resolution like AB |= C we will prove that AB ^ !C is a contradiction
